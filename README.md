# Python 4th

Forth, written in Python 3. Goals: low barrier to entry, extreme simplicity.

## Ariadne IIa

[Pre-release](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Python4th/tree/master/2a) of July "Forth" 2020 edition.

Accompanies ["Why can't Python deepcopy stdin?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62373655/why-cant-python-deepcopy-stdin)

### To Run

See the example at the top of the [source code](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Python4th/blob/master/2a/ariadne2a.py).

### Known Issues

Ariadne IIa is barely tested. The basic operations like `DUP`, `DROP`, and `OVER` seem to work, as do the two compilers (`:;` and the tripple `:`, \`, `;`).

A lot of essential features are yet to be incorporated (one development goal was to get the compiler working as soon as possible).

## Next Release

Ariadne II (without the "a") should have a more complete set of features, and should be more thoroughly tested.
