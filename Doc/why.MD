# Why Forth?

Forth is very likely the simplest, fully functional computer programming language.

How simple? Well, a lot simpler than Python, that's for sure.

Both Forth and Python receive lines of text input. Both Forth and Python break the input into _tokens_. Tokens are the simplest parts of code that have some meaning. For example, the symbol `+` is a token.

The difference comes in how they do it.

If you want to under stand how Python does it, you'll have to read [15 pages of text](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html) (4,430 words as of 2020-06-19), as well as some cross-references. The first bit is

> 2. Lexical analysis

> A Python program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, generated by the lexical analyzer. This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.

> Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a source file can be given by an encoding declaration and defaults to UTF-8, see PEP 3120 for details. If the source file cannot be decoded, a SyntaxError is raised.
