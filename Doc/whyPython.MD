## Why Write Forth in Python?

Because [worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better).

In light of the foregoing, I think it is safe to say that Python is much less consistent and much less simple than Forth when it comes to tokens and grammar.

But what Python lacks in simplicity and consistency, it perhaps makes up for in completeness.
I belive it is comlete enough to enable the writing of a Forth which is just as complete, but which is far simpler and far more consistent.
